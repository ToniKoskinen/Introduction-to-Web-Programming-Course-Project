# Introduction to Web Programming - Course project | Summer 2023

In this project, I created a website which visualizes results of the municipal elections in Finland from 1992 to 2021. Each color of a municipality shows which party has won there in that particular year. By clicking a municipality, user can see how the support of parties has changed during these years. User is able to add predictions to see how party support might change in the following years.

Please, see my [report](https://github.com/ToniKoskinen/Introduction-to-Web-Programming-Course-Project/blob/main/CourseProject_Koskinen_Toni.pdf) for more details.
